# What I did today

**Hello everyone!**

Today, I created my very own website!ðŸ˜€   

I learnt how to use Git, GitHub and Microsoft Visual Studio Code, and using Jekyll templates. It was NOT EASY  

I also needed to teach others how to make their own website (and add pictures)

I also learnt how to operate the laser cutter today. Turns out, there are so many other things to do, like aligning, and more.  

At least, I have a website for today. YAY!  

# My opinions and learning points

It was very satisfying to see the website come to life. There were a lot of hoops to cross (A LOT), like figuring out how to actually run the git commit code (before realising there is actually a much easier and intuitive method for doing it). I can now understand how to make new posts using a coding interface using Jekyll.  

# My hopes for tomorrow

However, I won't be here tomorrow due to NE Symposium. For Wednesday, I hope I can work on the lightbox, and operate the laser cutter, because it is more interactive and new to me.
