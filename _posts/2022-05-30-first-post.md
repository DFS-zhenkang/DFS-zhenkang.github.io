**Hello everyone!**

Today, I created my very own website!  

I learnt how to use Git, GitHub and Microsoft Visual Studio Code, and using Jerkyll templates. It was NOT EASY  

I also learnt how to operate the laser cutter today. Turns out, there are so many other things to do, like aligning, and more.  

At least, I have a website for today. YAY!
