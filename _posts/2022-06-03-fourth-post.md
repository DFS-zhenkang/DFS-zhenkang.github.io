# What I did today

I found out that silicon takes more than 1 day to fully solidify. wow  

We moved to another table :(, so I sit beside Tse Xin, and I teach her FEESIKS  

a.k.a power supply and electricity  

I was then tasked to work on RPA UIPath, which is ok i guess

# My opinions and learning points

Honestly, RPA is slightly confusing because of how the tiles are so oddly named  

It was fun teaching Tse Xin how to use the power supply though  

# What would I do tomorrow?

Quickly finish up with RPA, then move on to other stuff
