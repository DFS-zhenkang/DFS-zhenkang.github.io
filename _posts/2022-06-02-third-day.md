title: Third day at Science Centre
---

Hi. It's the third day.

# What I did today

Today, I finalised the 5 themes that are suitable, and presented the slides together with Jing Ting >.<  

I then played with the drone simulator lol  

Look who kept crashing  

I also made my own 3D printed rabbit (from the internet) then made it into chocolate mold! Can't wait to see it tomorrow

# My opinions and learning points

Really happy to finally finish the website part, it was really a rocky start to my first week here  

Turns out, the drone was really really hard to control  

I finally respect those at YFC lol

# What would I do tomorrow?

Look at chocolate mold, and honestly idk what else to do
